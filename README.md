# Python Learning Project

This project documents my journey learning Python and exploring various tools and extensions.  
I have practiced working with modules such as `openpyxl` for Excel file manipulation, `sqlite3` for database connections, and FastAPI for building web APIs.  
Through different scripts, I have learned how to read, write, and style Excel files, interact with SQL databases, and implement control flow using Python’s conditional and loop statements.

## Tools and Extensions Used

- **openpyxl**: Reading, writing, and styling Excel files.
- **sqlite3**: Connecting to and managing SQL databases.
- **FastAPI**: Creating RESTful APIs.
- **Python Standard Library**: Practicing with lists, loops, and conditionals.

## What I Learned

- How to automate Excel tasks with Python.
- How to connect and interact with databases.
- How to build simple web APIs.
- How to use Python’s control flow for data processing.

This repository contains scripts and examples from my learning process.
